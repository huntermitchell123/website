# Web App

This is the complete repository of my web app that is currently deployed to the world via AWS at https://huntermitchell.net/. 
The web app contains a home page and a project page which allows you to take a picture of yourself through webcam, 
and then uses machine learning on the backend to predict both your age and gender. Both models were trained using Google Colab.
The repo for that work is available at https://github.com/huntermitchell123/Face_Prediction/tree/main.

To replicate something like this, it is highly recommended to use Docker, as that made the transition to Amazon Elastic Beanstalk much smoother.
